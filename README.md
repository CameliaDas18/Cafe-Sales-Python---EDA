Project Overview:
This project involves the analysis and exploration of a cafe's sales data, aimed at uncovering key insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and operational performance. The dataset consists of information about transactions, including items purchased, quantities, prices, payment methods, and locations. The goal is to perform data cleaning, handle missing values, and carry out exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer business questions and provide actionable insights.

Objectives:
Sales Trend Analysis: Analyze monthly sales trends and identify high-performing periods.
Item Analysis: Investigate the most popular items based on revenue and quantity sold.
Location Performance: Evaluate sales distribution by location and identify top-performing areas.
Payment Method Distribution: Understand customer payment preferences and optimize the payment process.
Key Insights:
Highest Sales Month: October showed the highest sales of 7750.5, while March experienced a decline to 6934, highlighting potential seasonal trends.
Top Revenue Generating Item: Salad generated the highest revenue at 19125.
Most Sold Item: Juice was the most sold item with 4271 units, demonstrating its popularity.
Top Location: Takeaway contributed significantly to overall revenue, generating 62004 in total.
Payment Method: Digital Wallet was the most commonly used payment method, indicating a shift towards digital payments.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Data: Addressed missing values in various columns, such as Item, Quantity, Price Per Unit, Total Spent, Location, and Transaction Date.

Price Per Unit: Filled missing values with the mean.
Total Spent: Filled missing values after imputing Price Per Unit.
Quantity: Filled missing values with the mean to avoid skewing the data.
Item: Dropped rows with irrecoverable missing values.
Location and Payment Method: Filled missing values with the mode (most frequent value).
Transaction Date: Missing dates were filled with the most recent valid date.
Data Type Conversion: Ensured that numerical columns like Quantity, Price Per Unit, and Total Spent were converted to appropriate data types (float64 and int64). Transaction Date was converted to the datetime format.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The primary language used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling missing values.
NumPy: For numerical operations and imputation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization to create insightful charts such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.
Visualizations:
Monthly Sales Trend: Line chart to visualize sales performance over time.
Revenue by Location: Bar chart displaying total revenue generated by different locations.
Payment Method Distribution: Pie chart showing the most popular payment methods.
Item Analysis: Visualizations for top-selling items by quantity and revenue.
Conclusion:
This analysis provides valuable insights into the cafe's sales performance, item popularity, and customer preferences. By focusing on high-revenue items like Salad, optimizing takeaway services, and ensuring smooth digital payment experiences, the cafe can enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue.
